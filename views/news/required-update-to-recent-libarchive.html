<p>The compression algorithm <code>zstd</code> brings faster compression and decompression, while maintaining a compression ratio comparable with <code>xz</code>. This will speed up package installation with <code>pacman</code>, without further drawbacks.</p>
<p>The imminent release of <strong>pacman 5.2</strong> brings build tools with support for compressing packages with <code>zstd</code>. To install these packages you need <code>libarchive</code> with support for <code>zstd</code>, which entered the repositories in September 2018. In order for <code>zstd</code> compressed packages to be distributed, we require all users to have updated to at least <strong>libarchive 3.3.3-1</strong>. You have had a year, so we expect you already did update. Hurry up if you have not.</p>
<p>If you use custom scripts make sure these do not rely on hardcoded file extensions. The <code>zstd</code> package file extension will be <code>.pkg.tar.zst</code>.</p>
