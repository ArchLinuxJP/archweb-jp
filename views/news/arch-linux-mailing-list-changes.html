<p>As part of <a href="https://archlinux.org/todo/conversion-of-programs-that-use-python-2-to-python-3/">dropping Python 2</a> which is EOL, we have migrated our mailing lists from mailman2 to mailman3.</p>
<p>Rewriting of the "From" header and subject (to prepend the list name) have been disabled to keep the DKIM signature intact. This means "<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_guidelines#Reply_to_the_mailing_list">reply to mailing list</a>" must be used when replying to the list and you may need to update your filters and rules matching the "From" header.</p>
<p><strong>All existing subscriptions are migrated and you do not need to re-subscribe.</strong> For managing your subscriptions a new mailman3 account <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/accounts/signup/">must be registered</a>.</p>
