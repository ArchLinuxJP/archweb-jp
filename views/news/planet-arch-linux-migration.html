<p>The software behind planet.archlinux.org was implemented in Python 2 and is no longer maintained upstream. This functionality has now been implemented in archlinux.org's archweb backend which is actively maintained but offers a slightly different experience.</p>
<p>The most notable changes are the offered feeds and the feed location. Archweb only offers an Atom feed which is located at <a href="https://archlinux.org/feeds/planet">here</a>.</p>
