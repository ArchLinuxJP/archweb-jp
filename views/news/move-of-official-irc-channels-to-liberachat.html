<p>As some of you may have read over the past days, there has been an ownership dispute over the <a href="https://freenode.net">freenode.net</a> network. The IRC network has been used by Arch Linux and many other projects over the past decades as a platform for discussion and support.
The dispute led to the exodus of most former freenode staff from the network and the founding of a new network: <a href="https://libera.chat">libera.chat</a></p>
<p>Starting today, Arch Linux and its sister projects <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org">Arch Linux ARM</a> and <a href="https://archlinux32.org">Arch Linux 32</a> will begin migrating the official IRC channels from freenode.net to libera.chat. Please bear with us as this can take some time to be fully settled in.</p>
<p>We thank the freenode community for the many years of great service and collaboration.</p>
