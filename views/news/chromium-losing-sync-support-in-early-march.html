<p>Google has <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/limiting-private-api-availability-in.html">announced</a> that they are going to block everything but Chrome from accessing certain Google features (like Chrome sync) starting on March 15. This decision by Google is going to affect Arch's <code>chromium</code> package a bit earlier, on March 2, when Chromium 89 gets released.</p>
<p>We know for sure that <strong>data syncing</strong> will stop working (passwords, bookmarks, etc.). Other features such as <strong>geolocation</strong> or <strong>enhanced spell check</strong> might continue to function for a bit longer. Extensions integrating with <strong>Google Drive</strong> might misbehave and LibreOffice will lose access to documents stored there.</p>
<p>Other distros such as openSUSE and Fedora have already removed the soon-to-be-limited API keys from their Chromium 88 packages. Fedora's <a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-48866282e5">advisory</a> provides a great deal of perspective on this and I also found this Hackaday <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/01/26/whats-the-deal-with-chromium-on-linux-google-at-odds-with-package-maintainers/">post</a> to be quite informative.</p>
