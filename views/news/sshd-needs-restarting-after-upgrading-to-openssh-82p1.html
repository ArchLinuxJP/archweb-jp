<p>After upgrading to openssh-8.2p1, the existing SSH daemon will be unable to accept new connections. (See <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/65517">FS#65517</a>.) When upgrading remote hosts, please make sure to restart the SSH daemon using <code>systemctl restart sshd</code> right after running <code>pacman -Syu</code>. If you are upgrading to openssh-8.2p1-3 or higher, this restart will happen automatically.</p>
