<p>The zita-resampler 1.6.0-1 package was missing a library symlink that has been readded in 1.6.0-2. If you installed 1.6.0-1, ldconfig would have created this symlink at install time, and it will conflict with the one included in 1.6.0-2. In that case, remove /usr/lib/libzita-resampler.so.1 manually before updating.</p>
