<p>The hplip package prior to version 3.20.3-2 was missing the compiled python modules. This has been fixed in 3.20.3-2, so the upgrade will need to overwrite the untracked pyc files that were created. If you get errors such as these</p>
<pre><code>hplip: /usr/share/hplip/base/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-38.pyc exists in filesystem
hplip: /usr/share/hplip/base/__pycache__/avahi.cpython-38.pyc exists in filesystem
hplip: /usr/share/hplip/base/__pycache__/codes.cpython-38.pyc exists in filesystem
...many more...</code></pre>
<p>when updating, use</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Suy --overwrite /usr/share/hplip/\*</code></pre>
<p>to perform the upgrade.</p>
