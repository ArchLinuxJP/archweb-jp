<p>The new version of glibc removes support for NIS and NIS+. The default <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> file provided by <code>filesystem</code> package already reflects this change. Please make sure to merge pacnew file if it exists prior to upgrade.</p>
<p>NIS functionality can still be enabled by installing <code>libnss_nis</code> package. There is no replacement for NIS+ in the official repositories.</p>
<p><code>pam 1.3.0-2</code> no longer ships pam_unix2 module and <code>pam_unix_*.so</code> compatibility symlinks. Before upgrading, review PAM configuration files in the <code>/etc/pam.d</code> directory and replace removed modules with <code>pam_unix.so</code>. Users of pam_unix2 should also reset their passwords after such change. Defaults provided by <code>pambase</code> package do not need any modifications.</p>
