<p>Our <code>rsync</code> package was shipped with bundled <code>zlib</code> to provide compatibility with the old-style <code>--compress</code> option up to version 3.1.0. Version 3.1.1 was released on 2014-06-22 and is shipped by all major distributions now.</p>
<p>So we decided to finally drop the bundled library and ship a package with system <code>zlib</code>. This also fixes security issues, actual ones and in future. Go and blame those running old versions if you encounter errors with <code>rsync 3.1.3-3</code>.</p>
