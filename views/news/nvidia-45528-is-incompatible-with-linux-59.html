<p>nvidia is currently partially incompatible with linux &gt;= 5.9 <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/nvidia-driver-not-yet-supported-for-linux-kernel-5-9/157263">[1]</a> <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/68312">[2]</a>.
While graphics should work fine, CUDA, OpenCL, and likely other features are broken. Users
who've already upgraded and need those features are advised to switch to
the linux-lts kernel for the time being until a fix for nvidia is available.</p>
