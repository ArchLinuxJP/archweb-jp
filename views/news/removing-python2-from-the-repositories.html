<p>Python 2 went <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">end of life</a> January 2020. Since then we have been actively cutting down the number of projects depending on <code>python2</code> in our repositories, and we have finally been able to drop it from our distribution. If you still have <code>python2</code> installed on your system consider removing it and any python2 package.</p>
<p>If you still require the python2 package you can keep it around, but please be aware that there will be no security updates. If you need a patched package please consult the AUR, or use an <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unofficial_user_repositories">unofficial user repository</a>.</p>
