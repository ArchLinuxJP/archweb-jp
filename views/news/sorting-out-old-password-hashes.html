<p>Starting with <code>libxcrypt</code> 4.4.21, weak password hashes (such as <em>MD5</em> and
<em>SHA1</em>) are no longer accepted for new passwords. Users that still have
their passwords stored with a weak hash will be asked to update their
password on their next login.</p>
<p>If the login just fails (for example from display manager) switch to a
virtual terminal (<em>Ctrl-Alt-F2</em>) and log in there once.</p>
