<p>As announced on the <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2019-December/029752.html">mailing list</a>, on Friday, Dec 27 2019, our package compression scheme has changed from xz (.pkg.tar.xz) to <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2019-December/029778.html">zstd (.pkg.tar.zst)</a>.</p>
<p>zstd and xz trade blows in their compression ratio. Recompressing all packages to zstd with our options yields a total ~0.8% increase in package size on all of our packages combined, but the decompression time for all packages saw a ~1300% speedup.</p>
<p>We already have more than 545 zstd-compressed packages in our repositories, and as packages get updated more will keep rolling in. We have not found any user-facing issues as of yet, so things appear to be working.</p>
<p>As a packager, you will automatically start building .pkg.tar.zst packages if you are using the latest version of devtools (&gt;= 20191227).<br>
As an end-user no manual intervention is required, assuming that you have read and followed the news post <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/required-update-to-recent-libarchive/">from late last year</a>.</p>
<p>If you nevertheless haven't updated libarchive since 2018, all hope is not lost! Binary builds of pacman-static are available from Eli Schwartz' <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#eschwartz">personal repository</a>, signed with their Trusted User keys, with which you can perform the update.</p>
