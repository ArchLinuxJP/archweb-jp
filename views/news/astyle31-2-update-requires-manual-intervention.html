<p>The astyle package prior to version 3.1-2 was missing a soname link. This has been fixed in 3.1-2, so the upgrade will need to overwrite the untracked soname link created by ldconfig. If you get an error</p>
<p><code>astyle: /usr/lib/libastyle.so.3 exists in filesystem</code></p>
<p>when updating, use</p>
<p><code>pacman -Suy --overwrite usr/lib/libastyle.so.3</code></p>
<p>to perform the upgrade.</p>
